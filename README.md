# Leader-Election-process-in-distributed-systems-Bully-algorithm
The Bully Algorithm is a distributed consensus algorithm used in networked distributed systems to elect a leader among a group of processes. It ensures that all processes in a distributed system agree on which process will act as the coordinator. The algorithm is designed to handle scenarios where processes can fail and recover.
